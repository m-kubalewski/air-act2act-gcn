# Using machine learning methods to analyze the AIR-Act2Act data set
The following repository contains code used for my engineering thesis "Using machine learning methods to analyze the AIR-Act2Act data set". Thesis was written under the advice of dr. [Aleksandra Świetlicka](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=I2RIn8YAAAAJ&hl=pl) of Poznań University of Technology.

## 1. Obtaining the data
To obtain the 3D skeletal data go to the [ETRI AI Nanum](https://nanum.etri.re.kr/share/kowoori7/AIR-Act2Act-Else?lang=En_us), after signing the EULA agreement, download the skeletal data and put it in the folder named "raw_data", alongside other files from this repository.

## 2. Installing all required libraries
> pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Running the code
To obtain the results, run either of the jupyter notebooks.
